                        I’m an Application Support Engineer with 18+ years of experience keeping complex, high‑availability
                        systems online across SaaS, fintech and enterprise environments. My work centres on production support,
                        API‑driven platforms, and cloud‑hosted services, with a strong focus on monitoring, observability, and
                        incident ownership.

                    <p class="section-intro">
                        I design and maintain monitoring, alerting, and reporting using tools such as Splunk, Dynatrace,
                        Azure App Insights, Datadog and Grafana, helping teams detect issues early, reduce MTTR, and
                        understand how their systems behave in production. I collaborate closely with engineering, product,
                        and operations teams to diagnose issues quickly and communicate clearly with both technical and
                        non‑technical stakeholders.
